# Notes

These are all of my notes for programming, software development, GNU/Linux, markup / markdown, and more.

```c++
std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
```

## Categories

1.  $\LaTeX$
2.  Markdown
3.  OpenGL

## $\LaTeX$

### Learning

All of my latex documents for learning the markup language and styling.

### OpenGL

Limited notes on the OpenGL API for graphics programming in C++. See the markdown section for more notes, as that is how I'll be doing the rest of my OpenGL notes.

### Resume

My working resume, updated infrequently. Also a place for experimentation with formatting.

## Markdown

### APUSH

Possible place for AP United States / Virginia History notes. This might not end up actually being used for notes.

### Learning

Documents to test out markdown formatting and experiment with the language.

### OpenGL

Limited (if any) notes on the OpenGL API for graphics programming in C++. Again, see the OpenGL section for more info.

## OpenGL

Notes on the OpenGL API for graphics programming in C++. These notes will cover a broad series of subjects, and are mostly (if not entirely) derived from the [OpenGL playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2) by [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw) on YouTube. I will be making these notes at varying levels of depth, as these notes are also my way of learning and refining my markdown note taking style and methodology.
