# Game Engine

*My notes on the game engine series by The Cherno on YouTube*

## Structure

This set of notes will be organized by episode of the series, with each note document corresponding to each episode. The notes will be taken to the fullest of my ability, but they will by no means be perfect. You have been warned.

The purpose of taking these notes is so I can better understand the ideas and concepts from the tutorial series, as well as having a repository of notes I can turn to if I get stuck in the future. I will also be refining my note-taking process throughout the duration of this course, so expect changes in style throughout.

With that said, let's jump in!
